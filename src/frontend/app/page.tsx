          Tree of Thought AGI is an open-source project aimed at exploring the
          potential of artificial general intelligence (AGI) using the
          innovative{" "}
          <span className="font-black text-white">Tree of Thoughts </span>
          framework. Our goal is to empower language models to go beyond
          token-level decision-making and enable them to perform deliberate and
          strategic reasoning in problem-solving tasks.
          <br />
          <br />
          With Tree of Thought AGI, we introduce a novel approach that allows
          language models to consider multiple reasoning paths, self-evaluate
          choices, and explore various possibilities to make informed decisions.
          By leveraging coherent units of text ("thoughts") and incorporating
          iterative analysis and exploration, our framework significantly
          enhances language models' problem-solving abilities.
